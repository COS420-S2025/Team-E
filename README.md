**Problem Statement 1**:
1. Sellers often mislead consumers by overstating the computer's performance related to the needs of the customer. Many of these consumers don’t know what makes a computer “good”.
2. For example, consumers often buy these computers, not knowing that they’re overpriced and not suitable for their needs, leading them to get frustrated by their purchased computer’s poor performance afterwards.
3. Some personal computer and laptop catalogues allow users to search for devices based on the technical specifications in one centralized location, allowing comparisons between the performances of these devices, like PCPartPicker and Noteb.
4. However, these prior solutions are unintuitive for inexperienced users, listing the more technical details of a computer, using technical jargon that many users may not understand, like “TDP” or “L2 Cache”. These applications do not go into any detail explaining what these terms mean.
5. How can we make the computer device market accessible and easy to understand for all users of varying experience levels with computer specifications?


**Problem Statement 1 Draft 2 (Unused)**

1. Consumers have a need that can be accomplished by a computer. 
2. They look at computers and choose the one that looks the best, but many of these people return them for not fitting their needs. This resulted from a lack of knowledge on what each part of the computer was used for and a restriction of information from the tech store.
3. Prior solutions to this are college classes or YouTube channels that go through these previous topics. 
4. The issue with this is not everybody can afford the classes or can trust the YouTube influencers.
5. How can we design a web application to help make the knowledge of the computer parts more accessible to people?


**Problem Statement 2**:
1. A substantial number of people struggle with basic computer functions.
2. For example, users who are not familiar with the file directory system could lose or forget where they placed important files and documents on their computer, leading to lost work, slowed progress, and wasted time.
3. One solution is the Windows Help Menu, which can be accessed through the settings of a Microsoft device. It allows users to search up the problems with their machine that they need help/advice with, taking them to related forums and articles about said problems.
4. A problem with this feature is that not many Microsoft users know of its existence, and is hard to spot/find, as the user has to open settings and scroll down to the bottom and click a small, easily missable link that says “Get Help.”
5. How can we design an easily accessible system that provides fast assistance for everyday computer problems?
