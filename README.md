**Problem Statement 1**:

Some consumers want to buy computers. Many of these consumers don’t know what makes a computer “good”. Sellers often mislead consumers by overstating the computer's performance for certain tasks (gaming, office work, graphic design, etc).Consumers often buy these computers, not knowing that they’re overpriced and underpowered. Consumers get frustrated by their purchased computer’s bad performance (frequent freezing or slowdowns, low FPS in games, long loading times, long startup times). Some prior solutions assume that the user already has knowledge of computer parts, and so can be hard to use for beginners. How can we make it easy to understand how powerful/capable a given computer is?

**Problem Statement 2**:

A substantial number of people struggle with basic computer functions. They might not be informed or unaware of the various tools and functions computer websites and programs may have. Most informational resources and services such as filing for taxes are continuing to move into online environments. Some resources utilize a chatbot to help struggling users, but this assumes those users know how to or are capable of navigating through the environment. How can we educate and provide people with these skills to use these services and resources for benefit in their daily lives?
