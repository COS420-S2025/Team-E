Problem Statement:
- Some consumers want to buy computers.
- Many of these consumers don’t know what makes a computer “good”. 
- Sellers often mislead consumers by overstating the computer's performance for certain tasks (gaming, office work, graphic design, etc). 
- Consumers often buy these computers, not knowing that they’re overpriced and underpowered 
- Consumers get frustrated by their purchased computer’s bad performance (frequent freezing or slowdowns, low FPS in games, long loading times, long startup times). 
- How can we make it easy to understand how powerful/capable a given computer is?
